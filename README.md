# LINE Simulator for BOT developer

This repository is the fork version of [kenakamu/LINESimulator](https://github.com/kenakamu/LINESimulator). I forked it to work on Docker. Please use the original source when using the latest features.

The difference are:

* Add Dockerfile
* Remove browser startup process at process startup
